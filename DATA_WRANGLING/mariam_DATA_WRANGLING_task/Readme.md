Week 2 Task: Wrangling Online Retail Data

Objective: Utilise Python libraries like Pandas, Polars etc. to wrangle and prepare the dataset for further analysis.
Dataset: Online Retail - This is a transactional dataset which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.

Tasks:
Data Loading: Load the data using appropriate library and functions.
Data Inspection: Examine the data to understand data types, the presence of missing values, and general characteristics.
Missing Values:
Identify columns with missing data and their percentage.
Implement strategies to handle missing values based on the specific column and data characteristics.
Inconsistent Formatting:
Check for inconsistencies in data formats, typos, or mixed casing within columns.
Utilize string manipulation techniques (e.g., regular expressions) or conversion functions to achieve consistent formatting.
Incorrect Data Types: Investigate and fix incorrect column data types where applicable
Outliers: Are there Outliers in the data? If so, how will you handle them?
Data Validation: Implement checks to ensure data adheres to specific expectations. This might involve checking for valid values within a range or specific formats.
Documentation: Clearly document the cleaning steps taken and the rationale behind each decision.

Deliverables:
A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the data wrangling process.
Comments and explanations within the notebook for each step using markdown.
A cleaned and improved version of the dataset saved as a CSV file.

Bonus Challenge:
Explore techniques to identify and potentially remove duplicate entries in the dataset, if applicable.
Create new features derived from existing data.
